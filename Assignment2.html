	         <h2>Classic Horror Movie</h2>
			 
	  <p>Horror is one of those movie genres that seem to be perennially <b>popular</b>. 
	  Itâ€™s not hard to see why. The genre is built on the <i><u>thrill and excitement of terror</u></i>, 
	  of encouraging the viewer to feel as if their body is as vulnerable to destruction as
	  that of the characters. And, of course, there is also the thrill of seeing other people
	  find themselves in terrifying situations, even as the viewer (supposedly) knows more than
	  the characters.</p>
